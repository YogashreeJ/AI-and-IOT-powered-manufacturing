# AI-and-IOT-powered-manufacturing
This project integrates Artificial Intelligence (AI) with Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to optimize manufacturing processes, ensuring enhanced productivity, predictive maintenance, and quality assurance. The system leverages IoT sensors to collect real-time data from manufacturing machines, such as temperature, pressure, vibration, and power consumption. Using AI, the system performs predictive failure forecasting, monitors machine health, and ensures high-quality output by identifying anomalies in production.

Key Features:
Predictive Maintenance: The system uses sensor data (e.g., temperature, vibration, and power consumption) to predict machine failures before they occur, reducing downtime and maintenance costs.

Real-time Monitoring: Continuous monitoring of manufacturing conditions with IoT sensors, providing valuable insights into the operational status of equipment and processes.

AI-based Quality Control: Automated quality checks using machine learning algorithms to ensure products meet stringent quality standards.

Anomaly Detection: Identifying unusual patterns in real-time data to prevent quality issues or machine malfunctions.

Data-driven Decisions: Using data collected by IoT sensors, the system helps in making informed decisions regarding maintenance schedules, operational optimizations, and product quality improvements.
